# Fitness-Tracker

My app allows users to create, view and track workouts. The user can log multiple exercises in a given day and can also go back and update the workout. User can track name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of each exercise, and, as stated in our instructions, cardio exercises show the distance traveled in miles. I had a little bit of trouble creating the routes, but I met with my tutor, Jeremy, and he cleared it right up.
